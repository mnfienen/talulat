# We are going for a ride! 
miles today: 0 total miles: 0  

We are dusting off Talula the tandem to get some big miles in! This plan has been on the cooker for almost a decade - really since our last big ride from Madison, WI to New Orleans, LA but #lyf.

But now, we came from the west (CA-> Madison) went north (Madison -> Canadian Border on Lake Superior) and south to NOLA. Time to go east. We are heading out through Canada, out the St. Lawrence seaway, through Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick -- all the way the Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Not much else to say than we haven't had much time to train this hectic spring and early summer and the stoke level is high! We will start to post in August when we hit the road, but here's a couple photos from a recent training ride. Let's go!
