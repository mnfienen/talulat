# Last training ride in Wisconsin
miles today: 45 total miles: 0  

We had hoped to ride yesterday but the day got consumed with logistics. Always decisions about which camping gear to take? How light can we go? Is a blanket enough or do we need sleeping bags? Clothes on and off the bike? So....we saved riding for this morning. Got in a nice one with some short steep climbs and plenty of Dane County farmland. We both felt great, considering how little training we've gotten in!

The route was 45 miles

The cool morning air, a few other bikers, and the joy of just getting out and pedaling. It would have been a nice ride anyway, but knowing we launch in a week for a month on the bike definitely provides some scrutiny of how we feel, how things are looking, performance of the bike, and all that. We are lucky to live where the riding is so beautiful, but excited to get out and explore as well!

One thing we are trying new on this ride is using a GPS-enable computer for route-finding. In the past we have carried paper maps, relied on strangers, scrawled phone-based turn by turn directions onto scraps of paper. The only thing that really didn't work was trying to use phone directions all day. But this little computer gives us 17 hours of battery and integrates with online route planning. I think I like it so far, but can't decide if I love having this level of beta on climbs :).

We got home before 10:30 am so I can load my taiko and drums to head north for Searchlights practice today. No rest this week! Playing a gig at the Memorial Union Friday afternoon before we head out to Michigan and then onto the ride.
