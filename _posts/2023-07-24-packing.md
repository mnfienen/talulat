# So Much Packing
miles today: 0 total miles: 0  

The goal on the tandem is to go light. And really, the simplicity of having only what we need and nothing (well, little) superfluous is part of the appeal of this kind of travel. But like most simple things, it takes intension and work to make the complex into the simple. So...we explode potential gear all over the dining room and live with it for a few days. Every time we walk by we think "yeah, do I need that?" or "wow, we are missing this thing."
