# So Much Packing

The goal on the tandem is to go light. And really, the simplicity of having only what we need and nothing (well, little) superfluous is part of the appeal of this kind of travel. But like most simple things, it takes intension and work to make the complex into the simple. So...we explode potential gear all over the dining room and live with it for a few days. Every time we walk by we think "yeah, do I need that?" or "wow, we are missing this thing."

This is also the first time we are attempting to ride our ![Santana](https://santanatandem.com/) on a tour that does not originate at our front door. That means moving it in a car, a taxi, and flying home with it. More on those logistis as the time comes, but I'll leave you with a compressed hour or two it took to get the tandem ready for shipping.

We've had Talula the tandem for 18 years and it came with these S&S couplers, but we had not actually broken the seal on them until a month or two ago. It was a bit nervy to break down the bike (and more nervy to reassemble and confirm it was ridable!) but it worked then and I'd say I remembered 95% of the little tricks to break it down into a single hard-shell bike box and a hard suitcase.
