# A Searchlights Gig, Some Rest at the Beach
miles today: 0 total miles: 0  

We basically finished packing - got everything together that we could want anyway. Then in the super hot humidity of an August heatwave, headed to the UW Memorial Union Terrace so I could git in a gig wtih [Searchlights](https://www.searchlightsmusic.com). The show got moved indoors since a big storm was forecast to roll in. We had been looking forward to playing out on the Terrace with the amazing Lake Mendota backdrop and a huge built-in audience of people sharing beers and brats in the later afternoon. Moving into the Ratshkeller was cool, though, and the crew there were awesome, helped us sound good, and a bunch of family and friends were still able to join us and it made a nice sendoff to shift thinking toward the road!

After spending Friday night after the gig with friends who drove down from Minneapolis, we loaded up the car with everything (we hope!) and headed to the beach in Lake Michigan with the family for a few chill days on the beach. Always great to get some time here and the storm materialized and swept away the crazy heat and humidity. Long-term forecasts are looking like moderate temps and maybe even tailwinds! Expecting some rain as well, but everything is driving the stoke needle clockwise. Itching to go!
