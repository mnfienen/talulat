Today was a very chill partial rest day. This trip has an interesting cadence because these exciting Canadian cities we will visit - Toronto, Montreal, and Quebec City - are not really far enough apart to justify full rest days as they are only a few days between them on bicyle. We also wanted to visit friends and family in a couple spots, so to take advantage of the cities, we have planned partial rest days where we can cover some ground in the morning, arrive in enough time to explore the city a bit, eat well, stay in a hotel or AirBnB, and then get a late start the next day. This is also a distinct advantage of having long hours of daylight this time of year!

So, we packed up at the campground, did a round of Yoga stretching, and hit the road feeling refreshed and excited for short kms. Our route for the day was nearly all along the shore of Lake Ontario, through more tawny neighborhoods with lake views, some industrial areas, and loads of bike paths filled with walkers, bikers, dogs - it was a vibrant welcome into a big city. So nice to avoid traffic!

We pushed the kms and then stopped at a beach for a coffee and a nice dip of our feet in the lake. Chandra staged a charm offensive at the hotel for the night to get us early check in which meant stowing the bike for the night and getting a shower before venturing out into the city.

Today was a good day.  As we were leaving London, the weather was slightly cloudy (in a good way), and we had a light tailwind along a beautiful (albeit very straight) route.  We had some rolling hills for the first 100 km, but we still made good time at an average pace of 25 km an hour.  Since neither Mike nor I had much time to ride before we left, I quipped to Mike that the goal of the trip is "training, not torture."  And so far, that has been 98% true -- more on the 2% later.

One of the things that I love about these trips is how we fall into a natural rhythm.  The unspoken dance that sets our pace and gearing, when to coast and when to pedal, when to back off so that we can switch gears and when to lean in to regain momentum, and when the stoker (me) needs to "go jello-legs" so that the captain (Mike) can balance us through tricky spaces.  And sometimes it seems that when our bodies and motion attune to each other, our brains might also align to some mysterious wavelength.  For example, today we passed a sign that said, "Organic Eggs, $6.00."  We rode past it without comment, since we are not stopping to buy a dozen eggs on a tandem.  About two hours later, Mike says that we should look for an opportunity to get some Canadian cash.  I said, "Yeah, I thought the same thing when I saw the sign for the eggs."  And Mike laughed and said that it was the egg sign that had him thinking about getting cash because even if he wanted to buy eggs, we only have a Canadian $5 bill between the two of us.  Egg sign --> not enough money for eggs --> probably they only take cash --> we should get cash.  Our thinking may not be rocket science, but it is running on the same track for sure.  This happens several times a day on these trips, often becoming more prevalent as the mileage (or in this case, kilometers) pile up.  

At around 100 km, the rolling hills turned into a 10 (maybe more) km downhill as we fell off the Niagra Escarpment. The Niagra Escarpment starts at the south shore of Lake Ontario and proceeds westward along the top of the Great Lakes Basin and has the oldest forest ecosystem in North America.  It was pretty awesome to descend off of on a bike.

We were feeling strong and making great time, thanks to the tailwind and the downhill, until we were at the edge of Hamilton (which is where Canada's Royal Botanical Gardens are).  The Burlington Bridge leads out of town, and there's a beautiful bike path that takes bikers and pedestrians under the highway before (we thought) leading to a ramp to get on the bridge).  We rode in one direction, crossed under the bridge, and then rode in the opposite direction (think u-turn).  The other side was even more beautiful with small little islands, swans and ducks, and a view of Hamilton.

However, after a km or so, we didn't see anything that looks like a ramp that would get us on the bridge.  After checking the Ride GPS route, we turned around looking for a way up.  What we found was a metal staircase, 20 meters from top to bottom (that's 65+ feet).  It seemed the only way up, which we confirmed with a local.  Well, with nothing to do ascend, we took the bike apart and started climbing the massive staircase.  Mike sherpa-ed the loaded trailer, while I lugged the two paniers and our trunk up.  We had to rest as we ascended, but I was first, thankful that Mike is such a strong beast, and second, thankful to my cousin Kerry who has been training me this past year (with the last 4 weeks focusing on arms!).

And then, Mike had to go back down and push the tandem up.

We made it, but I have an appreciation for this bridge which is a National Historic Site of Canada (due to its role in repelling US forces during the War of 1812).  

Now we had just the final 30km to get through Burlington and into our first campsite at Bronte Station on the outskirts of town.  Riding through Burlington was city-riding, a combination of a rolling bike lane that took us past big mansions built along Lake Ontario and  sections of heavy city streets.  At the top of one of the hills in the swanky neighborhood, we passed (puffing and tired) a man in his truck who leaned out and with a huge smile and a thumbs up yelled, "Beautiful Teamwork!"  

Yes, today was a day of beautiful teamwork.

For me, it was also a day of gratitude towards Mike.  Thanks Mike for safely captaining through some difficult route-finding, for your sherpa-like strength getting the bike and trailer up to the bridge, for letting me take the first shower, and for your delicious shrimp linguine we had for dinner.

The crickets are chirping.  Fires are crackling. The campground is settling.  

We look forward to a short ride into Toronto tomorrow.

P.S., During our lunch break, we decided to go ahead and have the rear wheel rebuilt during our rest day in Belleville.  Although the wheel seems to be doing fine, we decided to follow the motto, "better safe than sorry" and make sure that we have a bomber rear wheel before heading into more remote territory on the second half of the trip.  This will entail a bike shop converting our front wheel (which has 40 spokes) to our rear wheel (which needs 40 spokes to handle the wieght of the trailer (and me)), and then putting a new standard wheel on the front.  Santana (our tandem's manufacturer) uses a 40-spoke front wheel exactly for this contingency as such wheels are not standard and difficult to find.  So thanks, Santana for thinking ahead and designing the tandem to carry its own spare, custom parts.
