We timed our rest days well with the first rest day hanging with Jason and Jovo and now the second rest day was with my cousin Joanna, her husbanc Casey, and their two boys, Owen and Liam.  And what a rest day it was!  

Of course, any perfect rest day (in my world, all good days) starts with a cup or two of coffee, preferably delivered bedside (Thanks, Mike!)  We then launched into a series of games with Owen and Liam, including one called Proof, which was described as a fast-paced simple mental math game.  It consisted of nine cards with numbers on them in which players raced to find equivalent mathematical proofs.  Think (6/2)+5 = 4x2.  Okay, I can handle this, I thought.  Then, all of a sudden I am staring at a set of cards with numbers like 99, 57, 32, 77, 49, 21, 14 . . .This is NOT something I could do fast . . . and this was not simple math.  We eventually figured out that someone had collected all the cards under 20 into a separate pile, but even then, it still wasn't that easy . . . not first thing in the morning on a rest day.  But Liam and I had a blast anyway.  

Since we decided to have the rear wheel rebuilt during our rest day.  The wheel was holding up fine, but now that we knew about the microcracks, we thought it prudent to replace the wheel before we headed into the longer, harder days.  Casey had recommended a local bike shop, at which we had made an appointment a few days prior so Casey and Mike out the tandem in a trailer and dropped it off at [Doug's Bike Shop](https://www.dougsbikes.com/) in Belleville.

Upon their return, Casey got the game crew organized with a fantastic breakfast of eggs benedict.  Liam ate THREE!  

My cousin Joanna had taken the day off of work so we truly had a day to play with them.  We went to a local brewery Gillingham's which had great beer and lawn games.  Although it was slightly rainy, Owen and Liam insisted that Casey and I have a axe throw-off once they learned that Casey had tied for first place in a benefit event for Sick Kids and I had won an axe-throwing contest held by the historical society in a teeny tiny town in Maine during an anniversary trip with Mike.  Casey's win was definitely more professional than mine.  His had real axes, a painted target and took place in a safety cage, whereas mine used three different axes (one required you bang the head into the hand before every throw), a huge stump for a target, and what seemed like the entire population of the town just milling about.  So, the two champions squared off.  This time throwing plastic "axes" at a plastic target that the "axes" usually just bounced off.  Even so, I "won" when one lucky throw actually stuck in the bulls eye.

After that, we picked up some wine at a local winery.  The area where the Hayes live has developed into a brewery/winery destination spot.  And it is just gorgeous.

When we got back to the house, Mike and Casey drove back into Belleville to pick up the bike.  Since I wasn't there for the bike repair part of the day, Mike's going to talk about it in a subsequent post.

We then got back to my favorite rest day activity -- cooking and eating.  

First, we snacked on fresh warm foccaccia that Casey's mom had made and his dad delivered to their doorstep just as we were arriving back at the house, while Mike and Casey picked up the bike.

Then, we had appetizers of freshly shucked oysters.  I love oysters, but Owen and Liam LOVE them.  They are the first small kids I have ever come across to love oysters.  According to Joanna and Casey, Owen was two when he asked if he could try one.  Joanna gave him one thinking "He probably won't like the briny, slimey thing anyway."  Upon swallowing, he apparently closed his eyes in bliss and than asked if he could have another.  Now both boys are oyster fieds.  So we collectively downed 3 dozen oysters . . . although the boys didn't get the fantastic Chardonney with their oysters.

But we weren't even close to being done.  There was homemade pasta to make, and Casey had bought these beautiful huge fresh trout, which we stuffed full of herbs from Joanna's beautiful garden.  We ate like kings!

Since I have large families on both sides of my family, often family gatherings are huge, loud and crazy gatherings.  I love those, but it is also a true gift when you get to have a smaller, more intimate visits.  Although both Mike and I have (on separate occassions) each had the chance to visit Casey & Joanna, this was the first time I got to see their house, really spend time with them as a family, and hang with their boys (and their dog, Millie).

We had a blast and can not thank them enough for their generousity and kindness.
