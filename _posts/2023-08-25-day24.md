We knew this day would come, and feeling are mixed to be sure. We feel a sense of accomplishment and kind of woke up thinking of today like the Champs-Élysées stage of the Tour de France - a shorter day, unlikely to change any outcomes. I wondered who would pour us champagne on the way into town. 

The sun rose over the Tidal Bore Inn and we made breakfast, happily using all but a few tablespoons of oatmeal and coffee, and burning off our remaining stove fuel making a second cup of coffee for each of us.

As Chandra mentioned, while we were at the tip of the Bay of Fundy and hoped to witness the tidal bore here, we couldn't really see it from our vantage point. It was definitely worth a try, though. As it was, we got going pretty early and started the day with a nice long flat stretch along the Bay to warm up our legs.

We turned south with a very heavy atmosphere of humidity and clearly the gray skies of the impending storm, but thankfully the winds (predicted to be straight in our faces from the south) were pretty gentle as we climbed some rural hills and made our way south.  

The riding was pretty, sometimes stressful with a fair bit of traffic and no shoulder, but, again, courteous drivers and safe passage (also managing to avoid the few potholes along the way and make it flat-free!).  

At lunch, we were happy to scoop out the final remnants of peanut butter from our jar and continue the using up of things we were carrying.

We followed the Shubenacadie river upstream then crossed into the nine locks of the Shubenacadie Canal that leads to Halifax. A little routefinding and rerouting, and we soon found ourselves across the bay from Halifax in Dartmouth. We paused to watch a couple 4-person canoe races (apparently this is the main canoe racing venue in Canada!).

Then up a couple hills, through the commons to a great view across the Bay into Halifax and then across the Bridge.

A little bit more climbing and recon and we made our way to the Good Robot brewery - just around the corner from the place we are staying - for a celebratory beer!

And just like that - we reached our destination! After a beer and a snack, we headed over to The Narrows Public House (amazing pub food and drinks!) where we have rented the AirBnB on the third floor above the pub. We quickly got to work sorting out groceries before a nearby store closed and disassembling the bike and trailer to be ready when Ryan (super kind guy who has been holding our boxes all month) and his partner Cait were planning to deliver the boxes (so kind!!).  

It was a little emotional to tear everything down after a month of so much care keeping all aspects of our gear functioning and happy. It also turns out that the Narrows is a hot newish spot in town, having gone through a decade of renovation (historic old building) and loads of care to refurbish and open as a fantastic gathering place for food and drink. As I worked on the bike, the owner and several of the staff chatted with me which was nice and a little distraction from the gravity of the moment. I trudged all the gear up to the third floor flat and carefully laid it out so we can box it up in the morning. When Chandra got back from getting groceries, we relaxed for a few minutes before joining Ryan and Cait for dinner in the pub.

It turns out Ryan and Cait are relatively new to Halifax, both Americans from the east coast who moved here from Northern California. They are a super cool couple (in addition to their generosity with the boxes) and we had a lovely time chatting about bike touring, places to live - a perfect couple to share our final night of biking with. While we are all very different, the crossovers were humorous (lived in the SF Bay Area, bike tourists, Americans, pescetarians, and officianados of Whipserlite stoves) - we joked that we had held the first meeting of a little society.  

And so, it ends like this. We accomplished our goal, got to experience a range of places, cultures, and environments across Canada. We beat the storm but still look forward to exploring Halifax in the rain tomorrow, thence to start the journey home. We plan to write one last blog post summing up our experiences (mostly for posterity and ourselves, but we will share it) so I will just leave you with this lovely photo of a souvenier that I may well have into the next year - a little tan line on my legs.

Thanks for everyone who has been joining us on this journey, and we are already thinking of what will be next!

We also wanted to take a moment and say fare thee well to Noel Robinson, Mike's sort-of-adopted uncle whose influence on Mike and his best friend Brady Robinson (Noel's nephew) can not be overstated. Noel was truly a free spirit and an avid biker.  

I met Noel for the first time on our cross-country trip from San Francisco to Madison in 2006 when he waited patiently sans cell phone or email at the bottom of a hill for several hours for us to pedal into town to meet him.  He knew that we would arrive eventually, the timing did not matter a whit.  He would have waited all night for us.  Since then, we met up with Noel almost every May for the [Lake Pepin 3-Speed Tour](https://3speedtour.com/), which he and a few other gentlemen founded nearly two decades ago.

Noel loved biking in Canada, especially in PEI, which is just across the bay from where we are this morning.  Noel passed away this past spring, going the way he would have planned it if he were a planner . . . during his sleep in his tent on a bike trip with friends.  We had carried a small vial of Noel's ashes along with us on this trip so that we could leave a bit of Noel on the shores of Nova Scotia. Fare Thee Well, Noel Robinson.

For anyone who has followed alongside us on this journey via our writings, you know that we quickly returned to our morning routine of packing up, caffeinating and oatmealing, squatting at mosquitos, bike-fiddling, and stretching, before pulling out of our home for a night and onto the road ahead. 

This morning, we hadn't gone more than an hour or so, when we rolled into Pugwash, which Mike had informed me was the Blueberry Capital of the World.  We'd been planning on stopping in Pugwash to partake (of course) when we crossed signs for locally crafted pewter things. For obvious reasons, we rarely stop to shop for anything other than consumables or tubes (which are, in reality, a consumable) on these trips, however, maybe it was because we are near the end that we stopped at a small shop called Basic Spirit.  While we had to refrain from its stone and pewter wine dispenser, we did find a small salt (or mignon) dish shaped like an oyster shell with a small starfish spoon. This seemed an appropriate keepsake for the trip -- especially given the oyster bonanza we had with the Hayes Family [see Day 7] (https://mnfienen.github.io/talulat/2023/08/08/day7.html) and that we've been following the starfish route since [Day 20] (https://mnfienen.github.io/talulat/2023/08/21/day20.html) . . . and because it is very light and very wee.

Unfortunately, we learned from the proprietor of the shop that Pubwash is not the Blueberry Capital of the World -- Oxford is, which at 30k to the southwest is NOT on our route.  So keepsake in my jersey pocket but sans blueberries in our stomachs, we pushed on through downtown Pugwash with Mike wishing for a cafe. 

Not 2 minutes later, we turned a corner and found Pugwash's morning gathering spot . . . with homemade cranberry scones and blueberry muffins.

The day then progressed uphill to lunch . . .

uphill some more to ice cream . . .

until finally a screaming 35km-long downhill stretch into Truro . . .  
<img src="../../../assets/images/day23/23_turo.jpg" width=450> 

. . . home of the Bay of Fundy, which has the infamously famous tidal bore (where the valley narrows and the tide is supposed to surge magnificently).  There's a Fundy Discovery Center at the edge of the bay with an observation stage and everything . . .

For a hydrologist, this was a must-see. . .
<img src="../../../assets/images/day23/23_tbi.jpg" width=450> 


. . . except not really, as basically all you see is a large bay, reminiscent of a rust-colored bathtub filling up and then draining over the course of an hour.

Luckily, while this was happening, this also was happening . . .

<img src="../../../assets/images/day23/23_dinner.jpg" width=450>  

So, while the tidal bore was underwhelming, we feasted on seafood linguine in butter and white wine sauce with charred onions and chiffonade brussel sprouts for dinner, paired with a crisp New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.

And now, we are prepared for the final day biking into Halifax.  There's a storm approaching, so we plan an early start and anticipate headwinds and possible rain, but hopefully, we will beat the heart of the storm.
